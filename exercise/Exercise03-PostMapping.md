# Exercise 03 - Post

Update the AnimeController by adding a new method that receives an Anime JSON via POST, adds it to the list of Anime, and returns the created object.
Restrictions: If an id is provided in the request, ignore it. Generate a random id before saving the object. The endpoint should be `/anime` and use the POST method.
